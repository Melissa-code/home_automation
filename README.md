# Domotique

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.


The goal will be to perform the following actions and functionalities:

- Create two buttons "Report a problem" and "Admin access".

- Display the time dynamically. It should be possible to increment the timer by 30 minutes each time the button is clicked.

- Change the states of the rooms (garage, pool, etc.) based on boolean color variables (red: false, green: true, blue: unknown).

- Add a button for each room that forces the status change.

- It should also be possible to record events (e.g., forcing the lighting of the pool, turning on the lights because a scenario is activated by the program...).
